 * Interface of a Feeder, which is used to feed scanner with IP addresses.
 * Basically, classes implementing Feeder must provide an algorithm of
 * sequentially generating the list of scanned IP addresses.
 *
 * Implementations should be 'immutable', i.e. once created, they should not
 * change their internal parameters (getInfo() must always return the same value).
 *
 * A new instance of Feeder will be created for each scan, passing the required
 * parameters to constructor. Default constructor should also be provided in order
 * to query name and id of the Feeder.
