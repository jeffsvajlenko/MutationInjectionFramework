/**
 * A selectable channel for stream-oriented connecting sockets.
 *
 * <p> Socket channels are not a complete abstraction of connecting network
 * sockets.  Binding, shutdown, and the manipulation of socket options must be
 * done through an associated {@link java.net.Socket} object obtained by
 * invoking the {@link #socket() socket} method.  It is not possible to create
 * a channel for an arbitrary, pre-existing socket, nor is it possible to
 * specify the {@link java.net.SocketImpl} object to be used by a socket
 * associated with a socket channel.
 *
 * <p> A socket channel is created by invoking one of the {@link #open open}
 * methods of this class.  A newly-created socket channel is open but not yet
 * connected.  An attempt to invoke an I/O operation upon an unconnected
 * channel will cause a {@link NotYetConnectedException} to be thrown.  A
 * socket channel can be connected by invoking its {@link #connect connect}
 * method; once connected, a socket channel remains connected until it is
 * closed.  Whether or not a socket channel is connected may be determined by
 * invoking its {@link #isConnected isConnected} method.
 *
 * <p> Socket channels support <i>non-blocking connection:</i>&nbsp;A socket
 * channel may be created and the process of establishing the link to the
 * remote socket may be initiated via the {@link #connect connect} method for
 * later completion by the {@link #finishConnect finishConnect} method.
 * Whether or not a connection operation is in progress may be determined by
 * invoking the {@link #isConnectionPending isConnectionPending} method.
 *
 * <p> The input and output sides of a socket channel may independently be
 * <i>shut down</i> without actually closing the channel.  Shutting down the
 * input side of a channel by invoking the {@link java.net.Socket#shutdownInput
 * shutdownInput} method of an associated socket object will cause further
 * reads on the channel to return <tt>-1</tt>, the end-of-stream indication.
 * Shutting down the output side of the channel by invoking the {@link
 * java.net.Socket#shutdownOutput shutdownOutput} method of an associated
 * socket object will cause further writes on the channel to throw a {@link
 * ClosedChannelException}.
 *
 * <p> Socket channels support <i>asynchronous shutdown,</i> which is similar
 * to the asynchronous close operation specified in the {@link Channel} class.
 * If the input side of a socket is shut down by one thread while another
 * thread is blocked in a read operation on the socket's channel, then the read
 * operation in the blocked thread will complete without reading any bytes and
 * will return <tt>-1</tt>.  If the output side of a socket is shut down by one
 * thread while another thread is blocked in a write operation on the socket's
 * channel, then the blocked thread will receive an {@link
 * AsynchronousCloseException}.
 *
 * <p> Socket channels are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.  They
 * support concurrent reading and writing, though at most one thread may be
 * reading and at most one thread may be writing at any given time.  The {@link
 * #connect connect} and {@link #finishConnect finishConnect} methods are
 * mutually synchronized against each other, and an attempt to initiate a read
 * or write operation while an invocation of one of these methods is in
 * progress will block until that invocation is complete.  </p>
