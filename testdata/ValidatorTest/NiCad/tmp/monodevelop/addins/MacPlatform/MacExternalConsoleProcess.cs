    NOTES ON CONTROLLING A TERMINAL WITH APPLESCRIPT

    	tab 1 of window id 35938

    //get whether the process is running, bash doesn't count for this, also doesn't seem reliable when waiting for input
    tell app "Terminal" to get busy of tab 1 of window id 35938
    	true

    //get processes running in tab, not very useful
    tell app "Terminal" to get processes of tab 1 of window id 35938
    	login, bash, grep

    //try to close the tab, fails
    tell app "Terminal" to close tab 1 of window id 35938
    	error: tab 1 of window id 35938 doesnâ€™t understand the close message.

    //try to close the window, can't stop it from prompting the user. maybe that's useful behaviour, like "press any key"?
    tell app "Terminal" to close window id 35938
    tell app "Terminal" to close window id 35938 saving no

    // name the tab
    tell app "Terminal" to set custom title of tab 1 of window id 35938 to "MonoDevelop Console"

    //make sure tab closes as soon as the process ends by queueing an exit command
    tell app "Terminal" to do script "exit" in tab 1 of window id 35938'

    //start named process
    tell app "Terminal" to do script "exec -a md_ps_333 grep -r foo /Developer"
    	tab 1 of window id 36206

    //kill the process we named
    killall md_ps_333

    using exec -a to name the process has problems because the terminal can get into a state
    where running an explicit exec causes it to quit after the exec runs, so we can't use the
    bash pause on exit trick
