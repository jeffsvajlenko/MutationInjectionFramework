% Based on the Java Language Specification, 2nd edition, 2001,
% and updated to 3rd Edition, 2007

% Modification Log:

% v3.6, Jim Cordy, March 2012.
%   Refactored to add [condition] for if/while conditions.

% v3.5, Jim Cordy, July 2011.
%   Tuning to improve parsing by specializing type components from reference compoenents

% v3.4, Jim Cordy, June 2010.
%   Minor fixes to annotations, reference components

% v3.3, Krellner/Reichel (Chemnitz University of Technology, Germany), September/November 2008.
%   New complex but JLS conform number token definition.
%   Token definition for both DOS and UNIX newline usage.
%   Fixed grammar resulted syntax errors.
%   Allowed method calls appended to a new class or array creation.
%   Modified class instance creations of nested/inner classes.
%   Allowed default array annotation.
%   Fixed logic error in class_instance_creation_expression.

% v3.2, Jim Cordy, October 2008.
%   Corrected method and constructor declarations to allow for generic parameters.

% v3.1, Jim Cordy, May 2008.
%   Validated on a range of open source Java software including JHotDraw 5.4b1,
%   Eclipse-Ant, Eclipse-JDTcore, Java2 SDK 1.4.0-Swing, Netbeans-Javadoc and Spule.
%   Updated to address slight problems.

% v3.0, Tom Dean, October 2007.
% -- updated to Java 5
% -- added assert statement (Java 1.4)
% -- added '$' to id character set
% -- added for/in statement (Java 5)
% -- added var arg modifier for method parametrs (Java 5)
% -- added keyword static to imports(Java 5)
% -- added enumerated types (Java 5)
% -- fixed label_statement (java 1.2)
% -- added annotations (Java 5)
% -- previous versions of the grammar conflated declared_name and
%    reference because javap inserted the package name as part of the
%    class name when analyzing libraries. With generics this becomes
%    too ambiguous. declared_name and refernce now have separate
%    definitions. To handle javap output, redefine declared name
%    as:
%	redefine declared_name
%	    [repeat pkg_class_prefix] [id] [opt generic_parameter]
%	end redefine
%    where pkg_class_prfix is defined as "[id] '."
% -- removed >>, >>>, >>= and >>>= from compounds and inserted [SPOFF] [SPON]
%    where they occur in the grammar. Conflicts with nested Genearics
%    such as List<List<Integer>>
% -- added generic and type wildcards (Java 5)
%
% -- TODO:
%      * Unicode. Java supposedly is Unicode in Java 5. Not exactly
%	 sure what it means for TXL.
%      * String escape codes including \u for unicode

% v2.0-2.3, Xinping Guo, July 2002.
%  -- Added 'strictfp in defintion of modifier.
%  -- Added [repeat component] after "( [expression] ') in defintion of primary.
%  -- Redefined "primary". Removed "primary_component" and "dot_primary_component"
%  -- Redefined "subprimary".
%  -- Removed "field_access", "method_invocation" and "constructor_invocation".
%  -- Redefined "reference".
%  -- Defined "component".
%  -- Defined "method_argument".
%  -- Defined a new nonterminal type called "declared_name".
%  -- "class_name", "interface_name", "variable_name" and "method_name" are "declared_name".
%  -- Changed "reference" to "variable_name" in "catch_clause".
%  -- In "constructor_declarator", changed "type_name" to "class_name".
%  -- In "implements_clause", changed "class_name+" to "qualified_name+".
%  -- Defined a new nonterminal type called "method_or_constructor_declaration".
%  -- In "member_declaration", removed "field_declaration" and changed  
%         "method_declaration" to "method_or_constructor_declaration".
%  -- In "class_body_declaration", removed "constructor_declaration" and
%         added "field_declaration".

% v1.0, Jim Cordy, fall 2001.
