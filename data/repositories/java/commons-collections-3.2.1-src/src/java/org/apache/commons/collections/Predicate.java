/**
 * Defines a functor interface implemented by classes that perform a predicate

 * A <code>Predicate</code> is the object equivalent of an <code>if</code> statement.
 * It uses the input object to return a true or false value, and is often used in
 * validation or filtering.
 * <p>
 * Standard implementations of common predicates are provided by
 * {@link PredicateUtils}. These include true, false, instanceof, equals, and,
 * or, not, method invokation and null testing.
