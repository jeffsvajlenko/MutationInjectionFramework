/**
 * Defines a collection that allows objects to be removed in some well-defined order.
 * <p>
 * The removal order can be based on insertion order (eg, a FIFO queue or a
 * LIFO stack), on access order (eg, an LRU cache), on some arbitrary comparator
 * (eg, a priority queue) or on any other well-defined ordering.
 * <p>
 * Note that the removal order is not necessarily the same as the iteration
 * order.  A <code>Buffer</code> implementation may have equivalent removal
 * and iteration orders, but this is not required.
 * <p>
 * This interface does not specify any behavior for
 * {@link Object#equals(Object)} and {@link Object#hashCode} methods.  It
 * is therefore possible for a <code>Buffer</code> implementation to also
 * also implement {@link java.util.List}, {@link java.util.Set} or
 * {@link Bag}.
