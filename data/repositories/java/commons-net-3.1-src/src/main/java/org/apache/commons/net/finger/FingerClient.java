/***
 * The FingerClient class implements the client side of the Internet Finger
 * Protocol defined in RFC 1288.  To finger a host you create a
 * FingerClient instance, connect to the host, query the host, and finally
 * disconnect from the host.  If the finger service you want to query is on
 * a non-standard port, connect to the host at that port.
 * Here's a sample use:
 * <pre>
 *    FingerClient finger;
 *
 *    finger = new FingerClient();
 *
 *    try {
 *      finger.connect("foo.bar.com");
 *      System.out.println(finger.query("foobar", false));
 *      finger.disconnect();
 *    } catch(IOException e) {
 *      System.err.println("Error I/O exception: " + e.getMessage());
 *      return;
 *    }
 * </pre>
