 *
 * The POP3* tests all presume the existence of the following parameters:
 *   mailserver: localhost (running on the default port 110)
 *   account: username=test; password=password
 *   account: username=alwaysempty; password=password.
 *   mail: At least four emails in the test account and zero emails
 *         in the alwaysempty account
 *
 * If this won't work for you, you can change these parameters in the
 * TestSetupParameters class.
 *
 * The tests were originally run on a default installation of James.
 * Your mileage may vary based on the POP3 server you run the tests against.
 * Some servers are more standards-compliant than others.
