/**
 * Represents a file, and is used to access the content and
 * structure of the file.
 * <p/>
 * <p>Files are arranged in a hierarchy.  Each hierachy forms a
 * <i>file system</i>.  A file system represents things like a local OS
 * file system, a windows share, an HTTP server, or the contents of a Zip file.
 * <p/>
 * <p>There are two types of files: <i>Folders</i>, which contain other files,
 * and <i>normal files</i>, which contain data, or <i>content</i>.  A folder may
 * not have any content, and a normal file cannot contain other files.
 * <p/>
 * <h4>File Naming</h4>
 * <p/>
 * <p>TODO - write this.
 * <p/>
 * <h4>Reading and Writing a File</h4>
 * <p/>
 * <p>Reading and writing a file, and all other operations on the file's
 * <i>content</i>, is done using the {@link FileContent} object returned
 * by {@link #getContent}.
 * <p/>
 * <h4>Creating and Deleting a File</h4>
 * <p/>
 * <p>A file is created using either {@link #createFolder}, {@link #createFile},
 * or by writing to the file using one of the {@link FileContent} methods.
 * <p/>
 * <p>A file is deleted using {@link #delete}.  Recursive deletion can be
 * done using {@link #delete(FileSelector)}.
 * <p/>
 * <h4>Finding Files</h4>
 * <p/>
 * <p>Other files in the <i>same</i> file system as this file can be found
 * using:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #resolveFile} to find another file relative to this file.
 * <li>{@link #getChildren} and {@link #getChild} to find the children of this file.
 * <li>{@link #getParent} to find the folder containing this file.
 * <li>{@link #getFileSystem} to find another file in the same file system.
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * <p>To find files in another file system, use a {@link FileSystemManager}.
