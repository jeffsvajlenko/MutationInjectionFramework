 * concrete RuleFinder subclass typically has Dflt as part of its name).
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class can also be regarded as a Factory for RuleLoaders, except that an instance of a RuleLoader is
 * only created if the particular finder algorithm can locate a suitable source of rules given the plugin class and
 * associated properties.
 * <p>
 * This is an abstract class rather than an interface in order to make it possible to enhance this class in future
 * without breaking binary compatibility; it is possible to add methods to an abstract class, but not to an interface.
