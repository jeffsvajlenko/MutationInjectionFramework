/**
 * A simple program to demonstrate the basic functionality of the
 * Commons Digester module.
 * <p>
 * This code will parse the provided "example.xml" file to build a tree
 * of java objects, then cause those objects to print out their values
 * to demonstrate that the input file has been processed correctly.
 * <p>
 * As with all code, there are many ways of achieving the same goal;
 * the solution here is only one possible solution to the problem.
* <p>
 * Very verbose comments are included here, as this class is intended
 * as a tutorial; if you look closely at method "addRules", you will
 * see that the amount of code required to use the Digester is actually
 * quite low.
 * <p>
 * Usage: java Main example.xml
