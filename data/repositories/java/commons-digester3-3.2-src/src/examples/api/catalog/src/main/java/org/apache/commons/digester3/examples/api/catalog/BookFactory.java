/**
 * The Book class doesn't have a no-argument constructor, so the
 * standard digester ObjectCreateRule can't be used to create instances
 * of it.
 * <p>
 * To resolve this issue, the FactoryCreateRule can be used in
 * conjunction with an appropriate factory class, like this one.
 * The "createObject" method of the factory is invoked to generate
 * object instances when required.
 * <p>
 * The factory object can access any xml attributes, plus of course
 * any values set up within it before digester parsing starts (like
 * JNDI references, database connections, etc) that it may in the
 * process of generating an appropriate object.
 * <p>
 * Note that it is <i>not</i> possible for any data to be extracted
 * from the body or subelements of the xml element that caused the
 * createObject method on this factory to be invoked. For example:
 * <pre>
 *  [book isdn="12345"]
 * </pre>
 * is fine; the isdn value can be accessed during the createObject method.
 * However, given the xml:
 * <pre>
 * [book]
 *   [isdn]12345[/isdn]
 *   ...
 * </pre>
 * it is not possible to access the isdn number until after the
 * Book instance has been created.
 * <p>
 * Note that even if the class to be created does have a default constructor,
 * you may wish to use a factory class, in order to initialise the created
 * object in specific ways, or insert created objects into a central
 * register, etc.
 * <p>
 * And don't forget, either, that factories may be implemented as
 * inner classes or anonymous classes if appropriate, reducing the
 * overhead of using this functionality in many cases.
