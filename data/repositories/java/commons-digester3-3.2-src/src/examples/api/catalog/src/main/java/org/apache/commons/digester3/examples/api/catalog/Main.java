/**
 * A simple program to demonstrate some of the functionality of the
 * Commons Digester module.
 * <p>
 * This code will parse the provided "example.xml" file to build a tree
 * of java objects, then cause those objects to print out their values
 * to demonstrate that the input file has been processed correctly. The
 * input file represents a catalog of items in a library.
 * <p>
 * As with all code, there are many ways of achieving the same goal;
 * the solution here is only one possible implementation.
* <p>
 * Very verbose comments are included here, as this class is intended
 * as a tutorial; if you look closely at method "addRules", you will
 * see that the amount of code required to use the Digester is actually
 * quite low.
 * <p>
 * Usage: java Main example.xml

        // of the internal hyphen. We could use explicit CallMethodRule
        // rules instead, or use a version of the SetPropertiesRule that
        // allows us to override any troublesome mappings...

        // If there was more than one troublesome mapping, we could
        // use the method variant that takes arrays of xml-attribute-names
        // and bean-property-names to override multiple mappings.

        // processing is applied, so xml attribute "category" --> setCategory.

        // We also need to tell this AudioVisual object that it is actually
        // a dvd; we can use the ObjectParamRule to pass a string to any
        // method. This usage is a little artificial - normally in this
        // situation there would be separate Dvd and Video classes.
        // Note also that equivalent behaviour could be implemented by
        // using factory objects to create & initialise the AudioVisual
        // objects with their type rather than using ObjectCreateRule.

        // to a call to setFoo("bar").
        //
        // This is an alternative to the syntax used for books above (see
        // method addSetNestedProperties), where the name of the subtag
        // indicated which property to set. Using this syntax in the xml has
        // advantages and disadvantages both for the user and the application
        // developer. It is commonly used with the FactoryCreateRule variant
        // which allows the target class to be created to be specified in an
        // xml attribute; this feature of FactoryCreateRule is not demonstrated
        // in this example, but see the Apache Tomcat configuration files for
        // an example of this usage.
        //
        // Note that despite the name similarity, there is no link
        // between SetPropertyRule and SetPropertiesRule.
