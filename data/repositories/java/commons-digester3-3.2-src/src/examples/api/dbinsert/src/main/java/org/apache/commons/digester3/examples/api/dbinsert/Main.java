/**
 * A simple program to demonstrate that the Commons Digester module can be
 * used to trigger actions as the xml is parsed, rather than just build
 * up in-memory representations of the parsed data. This example also shows
 * how to write a custom Rule class.
 * <p>
 * This code will parse the provided "example.xml" file, and immediately
 * insert the processed data into a database as each row tag is parsed,
 * instead of building up an in-memory representation. Actually, in order
 * to keep this example simple and easy to run, sql insert statements are
 * printed out rather than actually performing database inserts, but the
 * principle remains.
 * <p>
 * Very verbose comments are included here, as this class is intended
 * as a tutorial; if you look closely at method "addRules", you will
 * see that the amount of code required to use the Digester is actually
 * quite low.
 * <p>
 * Usage: java Main example.xml

        // "table" tag (normal behaviour for ObjectCreateRule). Because we
        // never added the table object to some parent object, when it is
        // popped off the digester stack it becomes garbage-collected. That
        // is fine in this situation; we've done all the necessary work and

        // This rule creates a Row instance and pushes it on the digester
        // object stack, rather like ObjectCreateRule, so that the column
        // tags have somewhere to store their information. And when the
        // </row> end tag is found, the rule will trigger to remove this
        // object from the stack, and also do an actual database insert.
