/**
 * A simple program to demonstrate the basic functionality of the
 * Commons Digester module with the xmlrules extension.
 * <p>
 * This code will parse the provided "example.xml" file to build a tree
 * of java objects, then cause those objects to print out their values
 * to demonstrate that the input file has been processed correctly.
 * <p>
 * Unlike the "addressbook" example in the "api" section, this implementation
 * has no parsing rules hard-wired into the code in this class. Instead, the
 * parsing rules are loaded from an external file at runtime. This allows
 * the parsing rules to be modified without compiling the code, and
 * potentially makes it somewhat easier to review the parsing rules.
 * <p>
 * Note, however, that there is tyically quite a tight coupling between
 * the parsing rules and the <i>purpose</i> of the application which means
 * that it may not be all that common for parsing rules to be altered
 * without the application code also being altered, so only in some cases
 * will this prove of benefit. As with all software, it must be determined
 * whether this feature provides a true benefit in the context of the
 * application it is being applied to.
 * <p>
 * Usage: java Main xmlrules.xml example.xml
