/**
 * A selectable channel for stream-oriented listening sockets.
 *
 * <p> Server-socket channels are not a complete abstraction of listening
 * network sockets.  Binding and the manipulation of socket options must be
 * done through an associated {@link java.net.ServerSocket} object obtained by
 * invoking the {@link #socket() socket} method.  It is not possible to create
 * a channel for an arbitrary, pre-existing server socket, nor is it possible
 * to specify the {@link java.net.SocketImpl} object to be used by a server
 * socket associated with a server-socket channel.
 *
 * <p> A server-socket channel is created by invoking the {@link #open() open}
 * method of this class.  A newly-created server-socket channel is open but not
 * yet bound.  An attempt to invoke the {@link #accept() accept} method of an
 * unbound server-socket channel will cause a {@link NotYetBoundException} to
 * be thrown.  A server-socket channel can be bound by invoking one of the
 * {@link java.net.ServerSocket#bind(java.net.SocketAddress,int) bind} methods
 * of an associated server socket.
 *
 * <p> Server-socket channels are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.
 * </p>
