/**
   * Client-side request interceptor.
   * <p>
   * A request Interceptor is designed to intercept the flow of a
   * request/reply sequence through the ORB at specific points so that
   * services can query the request information and manipulate the service
   * contexts which are propagated between clients and servers. The primary
   * use of request Interceptors is to enable ORB services to transfer
   * context information between clients and servers. There are two types
   * of request Interceptors: client-side and server-side.
   * <p>
   * To write a client-side Interceptor, implement the
   * <code>ClientRequestInterceptor</code> interface.
