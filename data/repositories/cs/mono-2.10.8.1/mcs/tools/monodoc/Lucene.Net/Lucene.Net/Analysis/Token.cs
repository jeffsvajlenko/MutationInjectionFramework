/// The start and end offsets permit applications to re-associate a token with
/// its source text, e.g., to display highlighted query terms in a document
/// browser, or to show matching text fragments in a KWIC (KeyWord In Context)
/// display, etc.
/// The type is an interned string, assigned by a lexical analyzer
/// (a.k.a. tokenizer), naming the lexical or syntactic class that the token
/// belongs to.  For example an end of sentence marker token might be implemented
/// with type "eos".  The default token type is "word".
