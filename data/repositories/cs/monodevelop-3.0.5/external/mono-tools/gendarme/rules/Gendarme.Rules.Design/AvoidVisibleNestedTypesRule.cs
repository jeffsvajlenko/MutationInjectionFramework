/// <summary>
/// This rule checks for nested types which are externally visible. Such types are often
/// confused with namespaces which makes them more difficult to document and find by
/// developers. In most cases it is better to make these types private or to scope them
/// within a namespace instead of a type.

/// <example>
/// Bad example:
/// <code>
/// public class Outer {
///	public class Inner {
///		// ...
///	}
/// }
/// </code>

/// Good example (visibility):
/// <code>
/// public class Outer {
///	internal class Inner {
