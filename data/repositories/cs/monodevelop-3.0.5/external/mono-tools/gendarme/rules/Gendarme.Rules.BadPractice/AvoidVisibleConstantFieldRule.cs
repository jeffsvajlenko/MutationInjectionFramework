/// <summary>
/// This rule looks for constant fields which are visible outside the current assembly.
/// Such fields, if used outside the assemblies, will have their value (not the field
/// reference) copied into the other assembly. Changing the field's value requires that all
/// assemblies which use the field to be recompiled. Declaring the field
/// as <c>static readonly</c>, on the other hand, allows the value to be changed
/// without requiring that client assemblies be recompiled.
/// </summary>
/// <example>
/// Bad example:
/// <code>
/// // if this fields is used inside another assembly then
/// // the integer 42, not the field, will be baked into it
/// public const int MagicNumber = 42;
/// </code>
/// </example>
/// <example>
/// Good example:
/// <code>
/// // if this field is used inside another assembly then
/// // that assembly will reference the field instead of
/// // embedding the value
/// static public readonly int MagicNumber = 42;
/// </code>
/// </example>
/// <remarks>This rule is available since Gendarme 2.0</remarks>
