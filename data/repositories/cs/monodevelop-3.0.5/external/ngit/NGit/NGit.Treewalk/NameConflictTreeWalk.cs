/// <remarks>
/// Specialized TreeWalk to detect directory-file (D/F) name conflicts.
/// <p>
/// Due to the way a Git tree is organized the standard
/// <see cref="TreeWalk">TreeWalk</see>
/// won't
/// easily find a D/F conflict when merging two or more trees together. In the
/// standard TreeWalk the file will be returned first, and then much later the
/// directory will be returned. This makes it impossible for the application to
/// efficiently detect and handle the conflict.
/// <p>
/// Using this walk implementation causes the directory to report earlier than
/// usual, at the same time as the non-directory entry. This permits the
/// application to handle the D/F conflict in a single step. The directory is
/// returned only once, so it does not get returned later in the iteration.
/// <p>
/// When a D/F conflict is detected
/// <see cref="TreeWalk.IsSubtree()">TreeWalk.IsSubtree()</see>
/// will return true
/// and
/// <see cref="TreeWalk.EnterSubtree()">TreeWalk.EnterSubtree()</see>
/// will recurse into the subtree, no matter
/// which iterator originally supplied the subtree.
/// <p>
/// Because conflicted directories report early, using this walk implementation
/// to populate a
/// <see cref="NGit.Dircache.DirCacheBuilder">NGit.Dircache.DirCacheBuilder</see>
/// may cause the automatic resorting to
/// run and fix the entry ordering.
/// <p>
/// This walk implementation requires more CPU to implement a look-ahead and a
/// look-behind to merge a D/F pair together, or to skip a previously reported
/// directory. In typical Git repositories the look-ahead cost is 0 and the
/// look-behind doesn't trigger, as users tend not to create trees which contain
/// both "foo" as a directory and "foo.c" as a file.
/// <p>
/// In the worst-case however several thousand look-ahead steps per walk step may
/// be necessary, making the overhead quite significant. Since this worst-case
/// should never happen this walk implementation has made the time/space tradeoff
/// in favor of more-time/less-space, as that better suits the typical case.
