/// <summary>An extended form of Bram Cohen's patience diff algorithm.</summary>
/// <remarks>
/// An extended form of Bram Cohen's patience diff algorithm.
/// This implementation was derived by using the 4 rules that are outlined in
/// Bram Cohen's <a href="http://bramcohen.livejournal.com/73318.html">blog</a>,
/// and then was further extended to support low-occurrence common elements.
/// The basic idea of the algorithm is to create a histogram of occurrences for
/// each element of sequence A. Each element of sequence B is then considered in
/// turn. If the element also exists in sequence A, and has a lower occurrence
/// count, the positions are considered as a candidate for the longest common
/// subsequence (LCS). After scanning of B is complete the LCS that has the
/// lowest number of occurrences is chosen as a split point. The region is split
/// around the LCS, and the algorithm is recursively applied to the sections
/// before and after the LCS.
/// By always selecting a LCS position with the lowest occurrence count, this
/// algorithm behaves exactly like Bram Cohen's patience diff whenever there is a
/// unique common element available between the two sequences. When no unique
/// elements exist, the lowest occurrence element is chosen instead. This offers
/// more readable diffs than simply falling back on the standard Myers' O(ND)
/// algorithm would produce.
/// To prevent the algorithm from having an O(N^2) running time, an upper limit
/// on the number of unique elements in a histogram bucket is configured by
/// <see cref="SetMaxChainLength(int)">SetMaxChainLength(int)</see>
/// . If sequence A has more than this many
/// elements that hash into the same hash bucket, the algorithm passes the region
/// to
/// <see cref="SetFallbackAlgorithm(DiffAlgorithm)">SetFallbackAlgorithm(DiffAlgorithm)
/// 	</see>
/// . If no fallback algorithm is
/// configured, the region is emitted as a replace edit.
/// During scanning of sequence B, any element of A that occurs more than
/// <see cref="SetMaxChainLength(int)">SetMaxChainLength(int)</see>
/// times is never considered for an LCS match
/// position, even if it is common between the two sequences. This limits the
/// number of locations in sequence A that must be considered to find the LCS,
/// and helps maintain a lower running time bound.
/// So long as
/// <see cref="SetMaxChainLength(int)">SetMaxChainLength(int)</see>
/// is a small constant (such as 64),
/// the algorithm runs in O(N * D) time, where N is the sum of the input lengths
/// and D is the number of edits in the resulting EditList. If the supplied
/// <see cref="SequenceComparator{S}">SequenceComparator&lt;S&gt;</see>
/// has a good hash function, this implementation
/// typically out-performs
/// <see cref="MyersDiff{S}">MyersDiff&lt;S&gt;</see>
/// , even though its theoretical running
/// time is the same.
/// This implementation has an internal limitation that prevents it from handling
/// sequences with more than 268,435,456 (2^28) elements.
