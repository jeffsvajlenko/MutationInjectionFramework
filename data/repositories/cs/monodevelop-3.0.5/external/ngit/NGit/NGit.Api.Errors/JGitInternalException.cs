/// Exception thrown when during command execution a low-level exception from the
/// JGit library is thrown. Also when certain low-level error situations are
/// reported by JGit through return codes this Exception will be thrown.
/// <p>
/// During command execution a lot of exceptions may be thrown. Some of them
/// represent error situations which can be handled specifically by the caller of
/// the command. But a lot of exceptions are so low-level that is is unlikely
/// that the caller of the command can handle them effectively. The huge number
/// of these low-level exceptions which are thrown by the commands lead to a
/// complicated and wide interface of the commands. Callers of the API have to
/// deal with a lot of exceptions they don't understand.
/// <p>
/// To overcome this situation this class was introduced. Commands will wrap all
/// exceptions they declare as low-level in their context into an instance of
/// this class. Callers of the commands have to deal with one type of low-level
/// exceptions. Callers will always get access to the original exception (if
/// available) by calling
/// <code>#getCause()</code>
/// .
