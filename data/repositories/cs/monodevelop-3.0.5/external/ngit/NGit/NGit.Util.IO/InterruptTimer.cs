/// <p>
/// Each InterruptTimer spawns one background thread to sleep the specified time
/// and interrupt the thread which called
/// <see cref="Begin(int)">Begin(int)</see>
/// . It is up to the
/// caller to ensure that the operations within the work block between the
/// matched begin and end calls tests the interrupt flag (most IO operations do).
/// <p>
/// To terminate the background thread, use
