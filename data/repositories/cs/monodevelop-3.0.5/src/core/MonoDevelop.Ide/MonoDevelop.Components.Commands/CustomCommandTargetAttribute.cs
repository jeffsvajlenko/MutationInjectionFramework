/// command execution behavior. It can be applied to classes or methods. The overriden Run method
/// will be called to execute commands.
///
/// When applied to a class, the Run method is called for all commands for which there is a command
/// handler in the class.
///
/// When applied to a method, the method must be a command handler (it has to have a [CommandHandler] attribute),
/// and the Run method is called only for the command that this method handles.
