 * Class for choosing a injection location for a function fragment.  Locations are chosen
 * as the line after a function existing in the specified system.  On creation the class
 * populates a list of possible locations.  Locations are selected on request at random
 * without repeats.  The selection set can be reset.  This chooser makes the assumption
 * that the source files in the system have been normalized such that code functions
 * opening and closing braces are on their own lines, which ensures that a function can
 * always be injected right after a closing brace and be a syntactically correct function.
 * 
 * Injection location is after functions rather than before in order to avoid separating
 * function signatures from their function.
